# Megarandom Chess
Shows start position for a game of chess with randomized starting positions and randomized board configurations. Inspired by [Fischer random chess (Chess960)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess) and the Age of Empires 2 random map script, ['Megarandom'](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/MegaRandom). 

## Features

Includes support for different board sizes from 8 by 8 up to 10 by 10, fantasy chess pieces, pieces from other chess variants such as Shogi and Xiangqi and different board layouts including the river and palace from Xiangqi.

The user can select different options in the top bar if they wish to exclude/include various random elements. The user can also activate 'crazy mode', which makes the chances of random elements appearing much higher and will result in an even less predictable game board.
